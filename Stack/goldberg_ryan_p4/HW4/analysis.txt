Analysis for the Big-O of the clear() function in my Stack class

template <typename T>
void cop4530::Stack<T>::clear() {
    l.clear();			//calls the clear member function for the list class
}

The list class' clear() function has a time complexity of O(n) as it must iterate through each element in the list and remove them.
Therefore the time complexity for my Stack's clear() function also follows a linear O(n).
